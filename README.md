## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### Useful resources

- [How to Convert Units of Measurement](https://brownmath.com/bsci/convert.htm) - This helped me grok unit conversions and improve the app architecture to make it "extensible" (adding new conversion factors and units).

- [You probably don't need input type="number"](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/you-probably-dont-need-input-typenumber/) - Short post on the pitfalls of using number inputs for things that aren't really "numbers" like credit cards and bank account numbers.

- [Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About inputmode](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-inputmode/) - This is where I discovered the existence of `inputmode="decimal"` which solved the issue where the number keypad on iOS when using `pattern="[0-9]*"` doesn't have a decimal button.
